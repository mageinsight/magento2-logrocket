MageInsight's LogRocket module will help the website owners to integrate LogRocket easily with Magento. This module provide the basic integration along with some advance configurations which an owner will require once they start capturing sessions in Logrocket.

I have followed [this documentation](https://docs.logrocket.com/reference/init) for integrating Logrocket in Magento. This module gives below capabilities:
- Capture session for logged-in and guest users.
- Flexibility to mask the elements which should not be passed to Logrocket. eg: customer's name and email.
- Mask all the input fields across the website.
- If you are using amasty GDPR module, then it have commented code which can be uncommented and then it will support AMasty's GDPR module as well.

Along with all this default feature, this module also provide an option to integrate more features using the javascript which is already added in logrocket.js file.
