<h2>Magento - LogRocket Integration</h2>
<p>MageInsight's ðŸš€ LogRocket ðŸš€ module will help the website owners to integrate LogRocket easily with Magento. This module provide the basic integration along with some advance configurations which an owner will require once they start capturing sessions in Logrocket.</p>

<p>I have followed <a href="https://docs.logrocket.com/reference/init">this documentation</a> for integrating Logrocket in Magento. This module gives below capabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ðŸš€ Enable/Disable Logrocket from Magento configuration.</li>
  <li>ðŸš€ Pass customerId & websiteId to Logrocket to debug customer's journey by taking their consent.</li>
  <li>ðŸš€ Capture session for logged-in and guest users.</li>
  <li>ðŸš€ Flexibility to mask the elements which should not be passed to Logrocket. eg: customer's name and email.</li>
  <li>ðŸš€ Mask all the input fields across the website.</li>
  <li>ðŸš€ Support for <b>Amasty's GDPR</b> module can be achieved. Module have few lines of commented code which you can uncomment and use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with all these default features, developer can integrate more features using the javascript which is already added in logrocket.js file.</p>
